At their core, **word embeddings are dense vector representations of words**.\n","\n","### **What are Word Embeddings?**\n","\n","Instead of treating words as discrete, symbolic units (like in one-hot encoding), word embeddings map words to points in a high-dimensional continuous vector space. Each word is represented by a vector of real numbers, where words with similar meanings are located closer to each other in this space. This proximity reflects semantic and syntactic relationships.\n","\n","### **Why are they important in NLP?**\n","\n","1.  **Capturing Semantic Relationships**: Traditional NLP models often struggle with understanding the nuances of language. Word embeddings address this by encoding meaning into their vectors. For example, the vector for \"king\" might be numerically similar to \"queen,\" and the vector difference between \"king\" and \"man\" could be similar to the difference between \"queen\" and \"woman.\" This allows models to generalize from limited training data.\n","2.  **Dimensionality Reduction**: Representing words as dense vectors is much more efficient than sparse representations (like one-hot encoding), especially in large vocabularies. This reduces computational cost and improves model performance.\n","3.  **Contextual Understanding**: Some advanced word embedding techniques (like Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, and more recently, contextual embeddings like BERT and ELMo) can capture the context in which a word appears, allowing for different vector representations of the same word based on its usage.\n","4.  **Feature Engineering**: Embeddings serve as powerful features for various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering, significantly boosting the performance of downstream models.\n","\n","### **How they represent words as numerical vectors:**\n","\n","Word embeddings are learned through various machine learning techniques, often neural networks, by analyzing large corpora of text. The process generally involves predicting a word from its neighbors or predicting neighbors from a word. During this training, the model learns to assign unique vectors to words based on their co-occurrence patterns and contexts. The resulting vectors are numerical arrays (e.g., `[0.1, -0.5, 0.8, ..., 0.3]`) where each dimension captures a latent semantic or syntactic feature of the word. These vectors effectively translate the complex, abstract nature of human language into a concrete, mathematical form that algorithms can readily process."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"05efad95"},"source":["## **What is BERT?**\n","\n","BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful, pre-trained language model developed by Google in 2018. It revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) by introducing a new approach to pre-training language representations, allowing models to understand context from both directions of a sentence.\n","\n","### Architecture\n","\n","BERT's architecture is based on the **Transformer** model, specifically utilizing its **encoder stack**. Transformers are neural networks that process input sequences using a mechanism called **self-attention**. Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that process sequences token by token, transformers can process all tokens in parallel, making them more efficient and better at capturing long-range dependencies.\n","\n","Key architectural components include:\n","*   **Encoder Stack**: BERT consists of multiple layers of transformer encoders. Each encoder layer includes a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise feed-forward network.\n","*   **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: This mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence when processing each word. \"Multi-head\" means it performs this attention mechanism multiple times in parallel, each with different learned linear transformations, and then concatenates the results.\n","\n","### Bidirectional Training\n","\n","The most significant innovation of BERT is its **bidirectional training** approach. Prior language models often trained unidirectionally (e.g., predicting the next word based on previous words) or Shallowly bidirectional (e.g., using concatenations of independently trained left-to-right and right-to-left LSTMs). BERT, however, learns context from **both the left and right sides** of a word during pre-training, which allows for a much deeper understanding of language context. This is achieved through two unsupervised pre-training tasks:\n","\n","1.  **Masked Language Model (MLM)**: In this task, a certain percentage (typically 15%) of the input tokens are randomly masked (replaced with a special `[MASK]` token). BERT's objective is then to predict the original vocabulary ID of the masked word based on its context provided by the unmasked words. This forces the model to learn deep bidirectional representations.\n","2.  **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**: This task trains BERT to understand the relationship between two sentences. For each pre-training example, BERT is given two sentences (A and B). 50% of the time, B is the actual next sentence that follows A, and the other 50% of the time, it's a random sentence from the corpus. BERT's goal is to predict whether sentence B is indeed the next sentence after A. This helps the model with tasks that require understanding sentence relationships, such as question answering and natural language inference.\n","\n","### Significance in Modern NLP\n","\n","BERT marked a significant breakthrough in NLP for several reasons:\n","\n","*   **State-of-the-Art Performance**: It achieved new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of NLP tasks, including question answering (SQuAD), natural language inference (MNLI), and text classification, significantly outperforming previous models.\n","*   **Transfer Learning**: BERT popularized the concept of transfer learning in NLP. A pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with a relatively small, task-specific dataset for a downstream task, requiring less data and computational resources compared to training a model from scratch. This made powerful language models accessible to a broader range of researchers and applications.\n","*   **Contextual Embeddings**: Unlike earlier word embeddings (like Word2Vec or GloVe) that assigned a single, static vector to each word, BERT generates contextualized embeddings. This means the embedding for a word changes based on its surrounding context in a sentence, accurately capturing polysemy (words with multiple meanings).\n","\n","BERT's introduction paved the way for many subsequent transformer-based models and firmly established pre-training and fine-tuning as the dominant paradigm in NLP research and application.\n","\n","### **Readings**\n","1. https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.048052."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"a6883aed"},"source":["## Setup Environment for PyTorch Sentiment Analysis\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Import necessary libraries for sentiment analysis, including `pandas`, `torch`, and `transformers` components like `AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModelForSequenceClassification`.

Summary:\n","\n","### Q&A\n","*   **What are the overall sentiment trends observed in the hospital exit interviews?**\n","    The sentiment analysis using the BERT model predicted a predominantly negative sentiment, with 66.91% (6,691 samples) classified as Negative and 33.09% (3,309 samples) as Positive. This contrasts with the original dataset's distribution, which was more balanced with 33.87% Negative (3,387 samples), 33.09% Positive (3,309 samples), and 33.04% Neutral (3,304 samples). The binary nature of the chosen BERT model (Positive/Negative) resulted in the reclassification of the original neutral sentiments into either positive or negative categories.\n","\n","*   **What are the performance benefits of using a GPU-enabled Colab environment for this task?**\n","    The GPU-enabled Colab environment (utilizing `cuda:0`) provided significant performance benefits. It allowed for the efficient processing of 10,000 text samples through a BERT model. Specifically, batch processing of the input data (e.g., with a batch size of 64) was crucial to prevent `OutOfMemoryError` on the GPU, demonstrating the necessity of GPU acceleration for handling large datasets and computationally intensive NLP models like BERT.\n","\n","### Data Analysis Key Findings\n","*   **Word Embeddings**: Word embeddings are dense vector representations that map words to numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space, capturing semantic and syntactic relationships. They are crucial for NLP by enabling models to understand meaning, reducing dimensionality, providing contextual understanding, and serving as powerful features for various tasks.\n","*   **BERT's Role in NLP**: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained language model based on the Transformer's encoder stack, utilizing multi-head self-attention. Its key innovation is bidirectional training via Masked Language Model (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), allowing it to learn context from both sides of a word. BERT achieved state-of-the-art performance, popularized transfer learning, and generated contextualized embeddings, revolutionizing modern NLP.\n","*   **Environment Setup**: The PyTorch environment was successfully configured to leverage the available GPU (`cuda:0`) for computations, ensuring optimal performance for the subsequent model inference.\n","*   **Data Processing**: The `hospital_exit_interviews.csv` dataset, containing 10,000 entries, was successfully loaded. The 'Exit Interview' text column was tokenized using `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`'s tokenizer, resulting in `input_ids` and `attention_mask` tensors of shape `[10000, 512]`, which were then moved to the GPU.\n","*   **Sentiment Analysis Execution**:\n","    *   A pre-trained `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` model, which performs binary classification (Negative/Positive), was loaded and moved to the GPU.\n","    *   Inference on the entire dataset was performed using batch processing (batch size of 64) to prevent `OutOfMemoryError` on the GPU.\n","    *   The model successfully generated logits, probabilities, and predicted labels for all 10,000 interviews.\n","*   **Sentiment Distribution Discrepancy**:\n","    *   The model predicted 6,691 (66.91%) Negative sentiments and 3,309 (33.09%) Positive sentiments.\n","    *   The original 'Customer Sentiment' column contained 3,387 (33.87%) Negative, 3,309 (33.09%) Positive, and 3,304 (33.04%) Neutral sentiments. The binary classifier re-categorized all original 'Neutral' samples, leading to a higher proportion of predicted negative sentiments.\n","*   **Visualization**: Bar charts effectively illustrated the distribution of both predicted sentiments and original customer sentiments, highlighting the difference caused by the model's binary classification.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","*   The choice of a binary sentiment classification model significantly impacts the perceived sentiment distribution, especially when the original data includes a 'Neutral' category. For a more nuanced understanding aligned with a three-category sentiment, consider using or fine-tuning a model specifically for ternary classification.\n","*   To accurately evaluate the model's performance against the original 'Customer Sentiment' labels, further steps could include defining a mapping strategy for 'Neutral' sentiments (e.g., converting them to the closest binary category based on context) or evaluating performance solely on the originally binary classified samples.\n"]}]}
