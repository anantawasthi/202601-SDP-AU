Definition of Text Chunking:**\n","\n","In the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data preparation, **text chunking**, also known as shallow parsing or partial parsing, is the process of breaking down a continuous piece of text into smaller, meaningful segments or 'chunks'. These segments are typically syntactically related, like noun phrases, verb phrases, or named entities, but they do not necessarily form complete syntactic trees.\n","\n","**2. Fundamental Concept and Necessity:**\n","\n","The fundamental concept behind chunking is to manage and process large volumes of text more efficiently and effectively. Large texts often contain a wealth of information, but directly processing them in their entirety can be computationally intensive, lead to loss of specific details, or overwhelm models that have token limits. By breaking down larger texts into smaller chunks, we achieve several benefits:\n","\n","*   **Manageability:** Smaller units are easier to handle, store, and retrieve.\n","*   **Focus:** It allows NLP models to focus on relevant portions of the text, reducing noise and improving understanding of specific contexts.\n","*   **Overcoming Limitations:** Many NLP models and APIs have input token limits. Chunking ensures that text fits within these constraints, making it feasible to process extensive documents.\n","*   **Preserving Context:** While breaking text down, the goal is to maintain sufficient context within each chunk, preventing important relationships or meanings from being lost across arbitrary splits.\n","\n","**3. Primary Purpose in NLP Applications:**\n","\n","The primary purpose of text chunking is to facilitate various downstream NLP applications by providing manageable and contextually rich segments of text. Some key purposes include:\n","\n","*   **Information Extraction:** Identifying and extracting specific entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) or relationships from text.\n","*   **Question Answering (QA) Systems:** When a question is posed, chunking allows QA systems to search and retrieve relevant text snippets rather than processing entire documents, leading to faster and more accurate answers.\n","*   **Summarization:** Breaking down documents into key chunks can be an initial step in identifying salient information for summarization.\n","*   **Semantic Search and Retrieval:** Improved relevance in search results by matching queries to specific, meaningful chunks rather than entire documents.\n","*   **Contextual Understanding for Large Language Models (LLMs):** Preparing data for LLMs by ensuring that input texts are within the model's context window while retaining as much relevant information as possible.\n","*   **Data Preprocessing:** Standardizing text input for various machine learning tasks."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1421ceac"},"source":["## **Importance of Chunking**\n","\n","Chunking is a critical preprocessing step in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines, especially when dealing with large volumes of text. It involves breaking down extensive documents into smaller, manageable segments or 'chunks' based on various strategies (e.g., fixed size, semantic boundaries, or specific delimiters).\n","\n","### **Benefits of Chunking:**\n","\n","1.  **Memory Efficiency:**\n","    *   **Handling Large Documents:** Modern NLP models, especially large language models (LLMs), often have strict input token limits (context windows). Directly feeding a very long document can exceed these limits, leading to truncation or outright rejection. Chunking allows processing of documents larger than the model's context window by feeding them in parts.\n","    *   **Reducing Computational Load:** Processing smaller chunks requires less computational memory and processing power per inference, making the overall pipeline more efficient. This is particularly beneficial for resource-intensive operations or when running on hardware with limited resources (e.g., GPUs with less VRAM).\n","    *   **Faster Processing:** Smaller inputs generally lead to faster inference times, which can significantly speed up applications that need to process many documents or respond quickly.\n","\n","2.  **Context Preservation:**\n","    *   **Maintaining Semantic Meaning:** Effective chunking strategies aim to keep semantically related sentences or paragraphs together within a single chunk. This ensures that the model receives a coherent piece of information, preventing the loss of critical context that might occur if a sentence is split haphazardly across chunks or if important surrounding information is truncated.\n","    *   **Avoiding Truncation of Important Information:** Without chunking, models might arbitrarily truncate parts of a document to fit the context window, potentially cutting off vital details. Chunking helps to manage this by allowing each significant part of the document to be processed, often with some overlap between chunks to ensure continuity.\n","\n","3.  **Model Performance:**\n","    *   **Improving Accuracy and Relevance:** By providing models with well-defined, contextually rich chunks, the model can better understand and process the information. For tasks like Question Answering (QA), summarization, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), better context leads to more accurate answers, more relevant summaries, and more informed generations.\n","    *   **Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** In RAG systems, chunking is fundamental. When a query is made, relevant chunks are retrieved from a vectorized database. If the chunks are well-formed and semantically coherent, the retrieved information will be highly relevant to the query, leading to higher quality augmented generations.\n","    *   **Specialized Processing:** Different NLP tasks might require different granularities of text. Chunking allows for tailoring the input to the specific needs of a task, optimizing the model's ability to perform that task effectively.\n","\n","In essence, chunking acts as a bridge, enabling powerful but context-limited NLP models to process and understand the vastness of human language more effectively and efficiently, leading to improved outcomes across a wide range of applications."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"14895611"},"source":["## **High-Level Chunking Strategies**\n","\n","Chunking is a crucial step in preparing text data for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, especially in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. It involves breaking down large documents into smaller, more manageable pieces or 'chunks'. Different strategies can be employed based on the specific requirements of the task and the nature of the text.\n","\n","Here are the high-level chunking strategies:\n","\n","1.  **Fixed-Size Chunking:**\n","    This strategy involves splitting text into segments of a predetermined, fixed length. For example, a document might be divided into chunks of 500 characters each. Often, an optional overlap is included, meaning a portion of the end of one chunk is repeated at the beginning of the next chunk. This helps maintain context across chunk boundaries and reduces the likelihood of important information being split across two chunks without any connecting context.\n","\n","2.  **Content-Aware (or Semantic/Structure-Aware) Chunking:**\n","    Unlike fixed-size chunking, content-aware chunking considers the meaning, semantic coherence, or structural elements of the text to make more intelligent splits. This strategy aims to keep related information together within a single chunk. Examples include splitting text by:\n","    *   **Paragraphs:** Each paragraph forms a chunk.\n","    *   **Sentences:** Each sentence forms a chunk (though this can often lead to very small chunks).\n","    *   **Document Sections:** Splitting based on headings, subheadings, or other structural markers in the document.\n","    *   **Semantic Coherence:** Using NLP techniques to identify natural breaks in meaning, ensuring that a chunk represents a complete idea or topic.\n","\n","3.  **Overlap-Based Chunking:**\n","    While often used in conjunction with fixed-size or content-aware chunking, overlap-based chunking is a distinct concept. It specifically refers to the practice of including a portion of the previous or subsequent chunk within the current chunk. The primary purpose of an overlap is to maintain context across chunk boundaries, especially when a query might involve information that spans two adjacent chunks. For instance, if a fixed-size chunk split a sentence in half, an overlap would ensure that both halves are present in at least one full chunk or that the context around the split is available."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"57677536"},"source":["## **Data Acquisition from Wikipedia**\n","Fetch the text content from the Wikipedia page 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India' to use as the base for all chunking examples.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"6428c677","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769009631433,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":470,"user":{"displayName":"Anant Prakash Awasthi","userId":"00676186995527977815"}},"outputId":"55089318-5a15-4137-b785-688dc1645bd4"},"source":["import requests\n","from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n","\n","print(\"Libraries imported successfully.\")"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Libraries imported successfully.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"bc03e840","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769009683950,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":857,"user":{"displayName":"Anant Prakash Awasthi","userId":"00676186995527977815"}},"outputId":"018c6256-fffb-416b-ff71-c6843a76a203"},"source":["wikipedia_url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India'\n","headers = {\n","    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3'\n","}\n","response = requests.get(wikipedia_url, headers=headers)\n","\n","# Check if the request was successful\n","if response.status_code != 200:\n","    print(f\"Error fetching page: Status code {response.status_code}\")\n","    wiki_text = \"\"\n","else:\n","    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n","\n","    # Try to find the main content area using id \"mw-content-text\"\n","    main_content_div = soup.find('div', id='mw-content-text')\n","\n","    if main_content_div:\n","        # Look for the 'mw-parser-output' div which usually contains the main article paragraphs\n","        parser_output_div = main_content_div.find('div', class_='mw-parser-output')\n","        if parser_output_div:\n","            paragraphs = parser_output_div.find_all('p')\n","            # Extract text, strip whitespace, and filter out empty strings\n","            paragraph_texts = [p.get_text().strip() for p in paragraphs if p.get_text().strip()]\n","            wiki_text = '\\n'.join(paragraph_texts)\n","        else:\n","            # Fallback: if 'mw-parser-output' is not found within 'mw-content-text', get all <p> tags from 'mw-content-text'\n","            paragraphs = main_content_div.find_all('p')\n","            paragraph_texts = [p.get_text().strip() for p in paragraphs if p.get_text().strip()]\n","            wiki_text = '\\n'.join(paragraph_texts)\n","            print(\"Warning: 'mw-parser-output' div not found within 'mw-content-text'.

If the resulting chunks are still too large (exceeding a `chunk_size`), the process is recursively applied to those oversized chunks using the *next* separator in the list.\n","2.  **Recursive Splitting**: The algorithm tries to split the text with the most 'coarse' separator first (e.g., `\"\\n\\n\"` for paragraphs). If splitting by `\"\\n\\n\"` yields chunks smaller than or equal to the `chunk_size`, these chunks are kept. If any chunk is still too large, it is then split by the next separator (e.g., `\"\\n\"` for newlines/lines) and so on.\n","3.  **Fallback to Characters**: If all defined separators have been tried and chunks still exceed the `chunk_size`, the final fallback is often to split by individual characters (using `\"\"` as a separator), which guarantees that no chunk will exceed the maximum length, though it might break words or sentences.\n","4.  **Optional Overlap**: Similar to fixed-size chunking, an `overlap_size` can be applied.

Unlike fixed-size or recursive character chunking, which primarily rely on length or structural delimiters, semantic chunking uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, often leveraging sentence embeddings, to identify meaningful boundaries and ensure that each chunk represents a coherent idea or topic.\n","\n","#### Working Principle\n","\n","1.  **Sentence Segmentation**: The raw text is first broken down into individual sentences. This serves as the smallest unit for semantic analysis.\n","2.  **Sentence Embedding**: Each sentence is then converted into a numerical vector (an embedding) using a pre-trained language model (e.g., Sentence Transformers). These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the sentences, with semantically similar sentences having embeddings that are closer in vector space.\n","3.  **Similarity Measurement**: The core of semantic chunking involves calculating the similarity between adjacent sentence embeddings. Cosine similarity is a common metric used for this purpose. A high similarity score indicates that two adjacent sentences are semantically related, while a low score suggests a topic shift or a natural break.\n","4.  **Boundary Detection**: Potential chunk boundaries are identified where the semantic similarity between consecutive sentences drops significantly. This can be done by setting a predefined `threshold` (sentences below this similarity are considered boundaries) or by finding local minima in the similarity scores, indicating a shift in topic.\n","5.  **Chunk Aggregation**: Sentences are then grouped together to form chunks, respecting these identified boundaries. The process also considers practical constraints such as a maximum `chunk_size` (e.g., in tokens or characters) to fit within model context windows and an `overlap_size` to maintain continuity between chunks, similar to other chunking methods. Overlap in semantic chunking might involve repeating sentences from the end of one chunk at the beginning of the next.\n","\n","#### When it is Appropriate to Use\n","\n","*   **High-Quality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Semantic chunking is highly beneficial for RAG systems. By ensuring that chunks are semantically coherent, the retrieval process is more likely to fetch relevant and complete pieces of information in response to a query, leading to more accurate and contextually rich generations from Large Language Models (LLMs).\n","*   **Complex Information Extraction**: For tasks requiring precise extraction of information, where understanding the full context of a statement is critical. Semantic chunks are more likely to contain complete thoughts or concepts.\n","*   **Summarization and Question Answering**: When summarizing documents or answering questions, preserving semantic integrity within chunks helps models grasp the main points and provide more accurate responses.\n","*   **Documents with Unclear Structural Boundaries**: In texts that lack clear paragraph breaks, headings, or other structural cues, semantic chunking can intelligently infer logical divisions based on content.\n","*   **Maximizing Context within Constraints**: It balances the need to break down large texts with the imperative to maintain as much meaningful context as possible within each segment.\n","\n","#### When it is Not Appropriate to Use\n","\n","*   **Very Short Texts**: For texts that are already very short or where the semantic content is extremely simple, the overhead of generating embeddings and calculating similarities might be unnecessary. Fixed-size or recursive methods could be more efficient.\n","*   **Real-time Performance Critical Applications**: Generating embeddings and calculating similarities can be computationally more intensive and slower than simpler chunking methods, especially for extremely large datasets or real-time applications where latency is a major concern.\n","*   **Strict Character/Token Limits**: While semantic chunking tries to respect `chunk_size`, the process of respecting semantic boundaries might sometimes lead to chunks that are slightly over or under the desired `chunk_size`, making it less precise than fixed-size chunking for very strict length requirements.\n","*   **When Content is Highly Disjointed**: If the text is inherently a collection of highly disjointed, unrelated sentences, semantic chunking might not find clear semantic boundaries, or the resulting chunks might still appear somewhat arbitrary."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"b86a7edb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769009848386,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4012,"user":{"displayName":"Anant Prakash Awasthi","userId":"00676186995527977815"}},"outputId":"74cd3445-cb5d-467a-e33c-f9ba3cc2e20c"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import nltk\n","from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize\n","from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n","from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n","\n","# Download the necessary 'punkt' tokenizer data for nltk, including 'punkt_tab'\n","nltk.download('punkt', quiet=True)\n","nltk.download('punkt_tab', quiet=True) # Explicitly download punkt_tab as suggested by the error\n","\n","print(\"Libraries imported and NLTK 'punkt' downloaded successfully.\")\n","\n","def semantic_chunking(text, model, chunk_size, overlap_size, threshold):\n","    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)\n","    if not sentences:\n","        return []\n","\n","    # Generate embeddings for each sentence\n","    sentence_embeddings = model.encode(sentences)\n","\n","    # Calculate cosine similarity between adjacent sentence embeddings\n","    similarities = []\n","    for i in range(len(sentence_embeddings) - 1):\n","        sim = cosine_similarity(sentence_embeddings[i].reshape(1, -1), sentence_embeddings[i+1].reshape(1, -1))[0][0]\n","        similarities.append(sim)\n","\n","    # Identify potential chunk boundaries where similarity drops below threshold\n","    # or by finding local minima more generally\n","    chunk_boundaries = [0] # Start of the first chunk is always a boundary\n","    for i in range(len(similarities)):\n","        # Simple thresholding for boundary detection\n","        if similarities[i] < threshold:\n","            chunk_boundaries.append(i + 1)\n","\n","    # Ensure the end of the text is a boundary if not already\n","    if chunk_boundaries[-1] != len(sentences):\n","        chunk_boundaries.append(len(sentences))\n","\n","    # Aggregate sentences into chunks, considering chunk_size and overlap_size\n","    chunks = []\n","    current_chunk_sentences = []\n","    current_chunk_length = 0\n","    last_added_chunk_end_index = 0\n","\n","    for i in range(len(sentences)):\n","        sentence = sentences[i]\n","        sentence_len = len(sentence) # Using character length as proxy for token length\n","\n","        # If adding the current sentence would exceed chunk_size, or if it's a identified boundary\n","        # and we already have some content, finalize the current chunk.\n","        is_boundary_point = (i in chunk_boundaries)\n","\n","        # If we hit a boundary or exceed max_length, close the current chunk and start a new one.\n","        # Only finalize if we have content in current_chunk_sentences\n","        if (current_chunk_length + sentence_len > chunk_size and current_chunk_sentences) or (is_boundary_point and current_chunk_sentences and i != last_added_chunk_end_index):\n","            # Finalize the current chunk\n","            new_chunk = ' '.join(current_chunk_sentences)\n","            chunks.append(new_chunk)\n","            last_added_chunk_end_index = i # Record where the new chunk ended\n","\n","            # Prepare for the next chunk with overlap\n","            overlap_start_index = max(0, len(current_chunk_sentences) - overlap_size) # overlap_size in sentences\n","            current_chunk_sentences = current_chunk_sentences[overlap_start_index:]\n","            current_chunk_length = sum(len(s) for s in current_chunk_sentences)\n","\n","        current_chunk_sentences.append(sentence)\n","        current_chunk_length += sentence_len\n","\n","    # Add the last accumulated chunk if any\n","    if current_chunk_sentences:\n","        chunks.append(' '.join(current_chunk_sentences))\n","\n","    # Post-processing to ensure all chunks are within chunk_size, especially if sentence length is large\n","    # This part can be tricky.

Its fundamental concept revolves around managing large texts, improving focus for NLP models, overcoming token limits, and preserving context. Its primary purposes include information extraction, question answering, summarization, semantic search, contextual understanding for LLMs, and data preprocessing.\n","2.  **Importance of Chunking**: Chunking was identified as a critical preprocessing step, offering benefits in:\n","    *   **Memory Efficiency**: Handling large documents within model context windows, reducing computational load, and enabling faster processing.\n","    *   **Context Preservation**: Maintaining semantic meaning and preventing arbitrary truncation of vital information.\n","    *   **Model Performance**: Improving accuracy and relevance for tasks like Question Answering, summarization, and especially Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by providing coherent, well-formed chunks.\n","3.  **Types of Chunking Strategies**: Three high-level strategies were outlined:\n","    *   **Fixed-Size Chunking**: Splitting text into predetermined lengths, often with optional overlap.\n","    *   **Content-Aware (Semantic/Structure-Aware) Chunking**: Splitting based on meaning, semantic coherence, or structural elements (e.g., paragraphs, sections).\n","    *   **Overlap-Based Chunking**: Including portions of adjacent chunks to maintain context across boundaries, typically used in conjunction with other methods.\n","4.  **Data Acquisition from Wikipedia**:\n","    *   The text content from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India\" was successfully fetched and processed.\n","    *   Initial attempts to extract text were unsuccessful, returning an empty string.\n","    *   A subsequent attempt to fetch the page resulted in a 403 Forbidden error, indicating server-side blocking.\n","    *   The issue was resolved by including a `User-Agent` header in the HTTP request to mimic a web browser.\n","    *   The main content of the Wikipedia page was successfully extracted, resulting in a `wiki_text` variable containing 65,980 characters.\n","5.  **Method 1: Fixed-Size Chunking**:\n","    *   This method divides text into segments of a constant character length, with an optional overlap to preserve context.\n","    *   Using a `chunk_size` of 500 characters and an `overlap_size` of 100 characters, the `wiki_text` was split into 165 chunks.\n","    *   It is appropriate for simplicity and speed, initial exploration, or when content structure is not critical, but can break semantic coherence.\n","6.  **Method 2: Recursive Character Text Splitter**:\n","    *   This method iteratively splits text using a prioritized list of separators (e.g., `[\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \". \", \" \", \"\"]`), aiming to preserve semantic units.\n","    *   With a `chunk_size` of 500, `overlap_size` of 100, and the specified separators, the `wiki_text` was divided into 270 chunks.\n","    *   It is suitable for preserving semantic units in complex text and is optimized for RAG systems, but can be overkill for simple cases.\n","7.  **Method 3: Semantic Chunking**:\n","    *   This advanced strategy groups sentences based on their contextual and thematic relatedness, leveraging sentence embeddings and similarity measurements to detect natural topic shifts.\n","    *   An initial `LookupError` for the `nltk` 'punkt_tab' resource was encountered and resolved by explicitly downloading it.\n","    *   Using the 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' SentenceTransformer model, a `chunk_size` of 500, `overlap_size` of 100, and a similarity `threshold` of 0.5, the `wiki_text` produced 15,263 semantic chunks.\n","    *   It is highly beneficial for RAG, complex information extraction, and documents with unclear structural boundaries, but is more computationally intensive and potentially slower than simpler methods.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","*   **Trade-offs in Chunking**: The choice of chunking method involves a trade-off between computational efficiency, preservation of semantic context, and strict adherence to length constraints.
