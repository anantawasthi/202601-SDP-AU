Instead of defining an iteration step and a condition, it iterates directly over the elements of a collection.

This makes `for` loops very readable and powerful for sequence manipulation."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"79c7c09b","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1768011765223,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Anant Prakash Awasthi","userId":"00676186995527977815"}},"outputId":"d0f68045-4f6a-43de-bfac-bbb0ad9c3f2e"},"source":["my_list = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n","\n","# Docstring: Iterate over a list and print each item.\n","\"\"\"This example demonstrates how to use a for loop to iterate through elements of a list.\n","Each fruit in 'my_list' is printed in sequence.\"\"\"\n","\n","# Iterate through each item in the list\n","for fruit in my_list:\n","    print(fruit) # Print the current fruit"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["apple\n","banana\n","cherry\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"a03fb0b1","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1768011765232,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Anant Prakash Awasthi","userId":"00676186995527977815"}},"outputId":"0106eb68-677e-4da6-e765-919d64769b79"},"source":["my_string = \"Python\"\n","\n","# Docstring: Iterate over a string and print each character.\n","\"\"\"This example demonstrates iterating through each character of a string using a for loop.\n","Each character in 'my_string' is printed individually.\"\"\"\n","\n","# Iterate through each character in the string\n","for char in my_string:\n","    print(char) # Print the current character"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["P\n","y\n","t\n","h\n","o\n","n\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"377c8fb6","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1768011765242,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Anant Prakash Awasthi","userId":"00676186995527977815"}},"outputId":"fbd15af9-51c6-4e7c-ba4c-09ce2b2a4e04"},"source":["# Docstring: Iterate a specific number of times using range().\n","\"\"\"This example uses the range() function with a for loop to iterate from 0 up to (but not including) 5.\n","It's useful when you need to perform an action a fixed number of times.\"\"\"\n","\n","# Iterate from 0 to 4 (5 times)\n","for i in range(5):\n","    print(f\"Iteration number: {i}\") # Print the current iteration number"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Iteration number: 0\n","Iteration number: 1\n","Iteration number: 2\n","Iteration number: 3\n","Iteration number: 4\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"42d2229d","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1768011765251,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Anant Prakash Awasthi","userId":"00676186995527977815"}},"outputId":"24ba8558-617d-4047-a28a-d372a06029d4"},"source":["fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n","\n","# Docstring: Iterate over a list with both index and value using enumerate().\n","\"\"\"This example demonstrates how to get both the index and the value of items while iterating over a list\n","using the enumerate() function.
