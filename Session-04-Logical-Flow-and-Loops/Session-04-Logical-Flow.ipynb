It tests a condition, and if the condition evaluates to `True`, the code block associated with the `if` statement is executed. If the condition is `False`, the code block is skipped.\n","\n","#### Explanation\n","The basic syntax of an `if` statement involves the `if` keyword followed by a condition, and then a colon. The code block to be executed conditionally must be indented. Python uses indentation to define code blocks, typically with four spaces.\n","\n","YouYou can also extend the `if` statement with `else` and `elif` (short for 'else if') clauses:\n","\n","*   **`if`**: Executes a block of code if its condition is `True`.\n","*   **`else`**: Executes a block of code if the `if` (and any `elif`) conditions above it are `False`. It's an optional catch-all.\n","*   **`elif`**: Stands for 'else if'. It allows you to check multiple conditions sequentially. If the preceding `if` or `elif` conditions are `False`, the `elif` condition is checked. You can have multiple `elif` blocks."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"bd41a9b3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1768011595565,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Anant Prakash Awasthi","userId":"00676186995527977815"}},"outputId":"7f3772ed-6d58-4a15-d74b-179e73911c15"},"source":["grade = 85\n","\n","# Check if the student passed\n","if grade >= 60:\n","    # This block executes if the condition 'grade >= 60' is True\n","    print(\"Congratulations!
