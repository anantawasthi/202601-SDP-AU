Understanding these structures is fundamental for writing efficient, clean, and scalable Python code.\n","\n","### Importance of Data Structures\n","Data structures are a way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They allow us to store and manipulate collections of data in a structured manner, which is crucial for solving complex problems in programming and data analysis. Choosing the right data structure can significantly impact the performance and readability of your code.\n","\n","### Basic Python Data Structures\n","This tutorial will cover the following fundamental Python data structures:\n","\n","1.  **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections that can store items of different data types. They are defined by enclosing elements in square brackets `[]`.\n","2.  **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections, also capable of storing items of different data types. They are defined by enclosing elements in parentheses `()`.\n","3.  **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique items. They are primarily used to store multiple items in a single variable and perform mathematical set operations. Sets are defined using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` constructor.\n","4.  **Dictionaries**: Unordered, mutable collections that store data in key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, and they are used to retrieve values efficiently. Dictionaries are defined by enclosing key-value pairs in curly braces `{}`.\n","\n","### **What This Tutorial Will Cover**\n","In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these data structures.

They are an ordered collection of items, and they can hold items of different data types.\n","\n","Here are their key characteristics:\n","\n","1.  **Ordered**: Lists maintain the order of elements as they are inserted. This means that if you add elements `a`, `b`, and `c` in that sequence, they will always remain in that order within the list. You can access elements by their index, starting from `0` for the first element.\n","\n","    ```python\n","    my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n","    print(my_list[0]) # Output: 10\n","    print(my_list[2]) # Output: 30\n","    ```\n","\n","2.  **Mutable**: Lists are mutable, which means their elements can be changed, added, or removed after the list has been created.
