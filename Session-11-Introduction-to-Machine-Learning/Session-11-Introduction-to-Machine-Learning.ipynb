The key principles include:\n","\n","*   **Goal-oriented learning:** The agent's primary objective is to maximize the total reward over time, not necessarily the immediate reward.\n","*   **Learning from interaction:** Agents learn by directly interacting with the environment, observing the consequences of their actions, and adjusting their behavior accordingly.\n","*   **Delayed reward:** Actions taken now might not yield immediate rewards but could set up the agent for larger rewards in the future. This introduces the exploration-exploitation dilemma.\n","*   **No explicit supervision:** Unlike supervised learning, RL agents are not told what actions to take. Instead, they discover the optimal policy through experience.\n","\n","### **Key Components**\n","\n","1.  **Agent:** The learner or decision-maker. The agent's goal is to maximize the cumulative reward it receives.\n","2.  **Environment:** The world with which the agent interacts. It receives actions from the agent and returns new states and rewards.\n","3.  **State (S):** A complete description of the current situation of the environment from the agent's perspective. It tells the agent where it is and what is happening.\n","4.  **Action (A):** A move or decision made by the agent that influences the environment. The set of available actions can vary depending on the state.\n","5.  **Reward (R):** A numerical value that the environment provides to the agent after each action. It indicates the desirability of the agent's action and guides the learning process. The agent tries to maximize the total accumulated reward.\n","\n","### **Algorithms: Q-learning and SARSA**\n","\n","Both Q-learning and SARSA are popular model-free reinforcement learning algorithms used to learn an optimal policy. They are both based on the Bellman equation and estimate the action-value function, $Q(s, a)$, which represents the expected future reward for taking action $a$ in state $s$.\n","\n","#### **Q-learning**\n","\n","Q-learning is an **off-policy** reinforcement learning algorithm. \"Off-policy\" means that it learns the value of the optimal policy independently of the agent's actual behavior policy. The agent can explore actions randomly, but Q-learning will still converge to the optimal Q-values.\n","\n","**Update Rule:**\n","\n","$Q(s, a) \\leftarrow Q(s, a) + \\alpha [r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]$\n","\n","Where:\n","*   $Q(s, a)$: The current estimate of the Q-value for taking action $a$ in state $s$.\n","*   $\\alpha$: The learning rate (0 to 1), determining how much new information overrides old information.\n","*   $r$: The immediate reward received after taking action $a$ in state $s$.\n","*   $\\gamma$: The discount factor (0 to 1), which determines the importance of future rewards.

It's often used when the goal is to find the optimal policy itself, even if the exploration phase is risky.\n","*   **SARSA (On-policy):** Learns the value of the policy being executed. If the agent's policy is to explore (e.g., using an $\\epsilon$-greedy strategy), SARSA will learn the value of that exploratory policy. This means SARSA is more sensitive to the path taken and tends to be safer in environments where optimal actions might lead to danger (e.g., in a navigation task, Q-learning might find a shorter but riskier path, while SARSA would find a safer path if the exploration policy discourages risk).\n","\n","In summary, Q-learning seeks the true optimal Q-function regardless of the exploration strategy, while SARSA learns the Q-function for the policy it is currently following."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"378e5d58"},"source":["### **Selected Algorithms for Detailed Explanation**\n","\n","To provide a comprehensive overview of machine learning algorithms, we will delve into the working principles and mathematical concepts of the following key algorithms, categorized by their respective learning methods:\n","\n","#### **1.

This process continues until a desired number of components is reached or all components are extracted.\n","\n","The steps involved are typically:\n","\n","1.  **Standardization**: Scale the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

For continuous spaces, function approximation methods (like neural networks, leading to Deep Q-Networks or DQN) are required.\n","*   **Convergence**: Q-Learning is guaranteed to converge to an optimal policy under certain conditions: the environment is stationary, all state-action pairs are visited infinitely often, and the learning rate decays appropriately.\n","*   **Model-Free**: While an advantage (no need for environment model), it means Q-Learning can be slower to learn than model-based approaches, as it has to learn from direct experience.\n","*   **Scalability Issues**: For environments with a very large number of states, storing and updating the Q-table can become computationally infeasible and require enormous memory.
