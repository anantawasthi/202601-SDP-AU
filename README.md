## 🌟 Why This Program Exists

Many students are curious about **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence**, but don’t know where or how to begin. This Skill Development Program is designed precisely for that moment.

No assumptions.  
No heavy math.  
No prior coding experience.

Just a **clear, guided, hands-on journey** that starts from zero and builds real confidence—step by step.

By the end of this workshop, participants won’t just *know about* AI and Data Science—they’ll **use it**, **code it**, and **understand how modern AI systems are actually built**.

## 🧠 What Makes This Program Different

This isn’t a lecture-heavy seminar. It’s a **build-along experience**.

You will:

- Write real Python code  
- Work with real datasets  
- Visualize data like a data scientist  
- Understand how Machine Learning works (without fear)  
- Explore how ChatGPT-like systems are built using **Generative AI, RAG, and Agents**  
- Learn professional workflows used in industry and research  

Everything is taught through **clarity, intuition, and application**—not jargon.
