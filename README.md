## 🌟 About the Program

This Skill Development Program is a **five-hour immersive workshop** designed for students who are curious about Data Science and Artificial Intelligence and are taking their **first steps into the field**.

No prior experience in Python, Machine Learning, or AI is required.

The program is carefully structured to help learners move from basic orientation and programming fundamentals to working with data, visualizing insights, and understanding how modern intelligent systems—such as Generative AI and RAG-based applications—are built and used in practice.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

This is not a theory-heavy seminar.  
It is a **learn-by-doing program**.

Participants will:

- Write real Python code  
- Work with datasets and visualizations  
- Learn industry-standard thinking using CRISP-DM  
- Understand Machine Learning and NLP without intimidation  
- Explore how Generative AI systems work beyond just using ChatGPT  

The focus is on **clarity, intuition, and practical confidence**.
